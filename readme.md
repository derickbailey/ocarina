# Ocarina: Simplified Oracle Data Access

Ocarina aims to simplify Oracle data access with Node, by creating a 
friendlier API on top of [the official Oracle driver for Node](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb).

## Getting Started

You will need to [install the official Oracle driver](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
first. Once you have done that, you can install and use Ocarina.

* `npm install --save oracledb ocarina`
